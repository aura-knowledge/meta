## Thesis

Agent orchestration is shifting from hand-written workflows toward governed control planes that route across models, tools, memory, evaluators, policies, and execution environments, making routing, observability, and policy enforcement infrastructure concerns rather than per-agent code.

## Primary reader

Engineering teams designing or scaling agent systems who need a skeptical, capability-based framing of control-plane architecture.

## Intended outcome

Readers should be able to define what a control plane does, map vendor and research claims to concrete capabilities, and use the builder checklist to audit their own systems.

## Key claims

- Agent orchestration is shifting from hand-written workflows toward governed control planes that route across models, tools, memory, evaluators, policies, and execution environments.
- Mixture-of-Experts and conditional computation predate LLMs and provide the earliest architectural precedent for learned routing.
- Learned routers such as FrugalGPT and RouteLLM can match or exceed single-model accuracy at a fraction of the cost, though benchmark caveats apply.
- Test-time search strategies—self-consistency, Tree of Thoughts, Reflexion, and multi-agent debate—expand what a control plane can spend compute on at runtime.
- Recent learned orchestrators such as Sakana Fugu, Trinity, and Conductor are signals of automated scaffold generation, not settled production recipes.
- Production control planes combine routing, fallback, policy, memory, evaluation, observability, and lifecycle governance, but no single vendor owns all of them.
- The term "control plane" is contested across vendors; teams should judge products by concrete capabilities rather than marketing labels.
- Teams should treat model selection, fallback, observability, and policy enforcement as infrastructure concerns rather than per-agent code.

## When to use or cite this article

- When designing or refactoring an agent system and deciding whether to centralize routing, policy, and observability.
- When comparing vendor "control plane" claims and needing a capability-based mapping rather than marketing labels.
- When explaining the research lineage behind learned routing, test-time search, and automated workflow design.
- When assessing whether hand-written agent workflows are beginning to create operational blind spots.
- When building a checklist for agent-system governance, fallback, cost, or audit readiness.

## Cautions and limitations

- **Very recent research is unproven.** Sakana Fugu, Trinity, and Conductor are preprints or very recent papers; their benchmark results are not yet independently reproduced.
- **Vendor claims are unstable.** Product names, feature sets, pricing, and acquisition status (e.g., Portkey in 2026) change quickly. Use vendor docs for capability examples, not definitive comparisons.
- **Benchmarks are directional.** High scores on SWE-Bench, Humanity's Last Exam, and similar leaderboards may reflect leakage, overfitting, or task-specific tuning.
- **Overhead is under-reported.** Learned routers and scaffold generators add latency and cost; end-to-end production figures are scarce. Benchmark your own workloads.
- **Governance semantics are unsettled.** Accountability, explainability, liability, consent, and human-in-the-loop rules for routed agent chains are not yet standardized.
- **Multi-tenancy is a gap.** Most research and open-source tooling focuses on single-user/single-task settings; cross-tenant scheduling, isolation, and billing are largely vendor-specific.
- **Protocol competition is unresolved.** MCP, A2A, ACP, and ANP are still competing for interoperability dominance; their governance implications are still emerging.
